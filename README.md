#Frogger Game#
Here we have my implementation for the classic video game Frogger. 

###How to run the game###
Getting started is easy, simply open index.html and the game will begin running.

###How to play the game###
The game objective is to make the player reach the water as many times without being hit by a moving enemy. The player can be controlled using the directional keys (up, down, left, right) on the keyboard. There is a scoreboard on the top right corner showing how many times the player has successfully made it to the water without being hit.
